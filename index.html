      <ul>
       
            <li>
            Preheat your oven to the highest temperature (usually around 475-500°F
            or 245-260°C).
          </li>
          <li>
            Roll out the pizza dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
            If using store-bought dough, follow the package instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer the rolled-out dough to a baking sheet or pizza stone lined
            with parchment paper.
          </li>
          <li>
            Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border
            around the edges for the crust.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sprinkle the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, covering the
            entire pizza.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tear the fresh basil leaves into small pieces and distribute them evenly
            on top of the cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drizzle the extra virgin olive oil over the pizza and season with salt
            and pepper to taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for about 10-15 minutes,
            or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly
            browned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before
            slicing.
          </li>
          <li>Serve the Margherita pizza hot and enjoy!</li>
